# GUI-Win32-Video-Rental-Framework-
A .NET application that offers the functionality of a video rental system. Microsoft database is used for storage. Some features still have not been completed.

# Summary
This was a .NET project I completed for a CS course I took in Emporia Kansas. I could not find the
final distribution of this application so the version presented with this download is incomplete, although
many of the features are implemented in this version. It uses a Microsoft data base for record keeping,
and has many of the features you would expect in video rental software.

Usage: The username is ‘Tester’, and the password is ‘Test’.
